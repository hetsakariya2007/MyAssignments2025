            <h2>Mutual fund statistics</h2>

            <p>
                The first introduction of a mutual fund in India occurred in 1963, when the Government of India launched
                the <strong>Unit Trust of India (UTI)</strong>.
                Mutual funds in India are broadly categorised into equity funds, hybrid funds and debt funds.
            </p>

            <p>
                Key statistics (examples taken from public reports and industry releases):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The total Assets Under Management (AUM) of the Indian mutual fund industry as of <strong>December
                        31, 2023</strong> stood at approximately <strong>₹50.78 trillion</strong> (≈ US$600
                    billion).<sup>[1]</sup></li>
                <li>According to SEBI, during FY 2022–23, a large share of mutual fund units were redeemed within two
                    years of investment; a smaller fraction remained invested for over five years.<sup>[2]</sup></li>
                <li>Mutual funds attracted a modest share of household savings relative to bank deposits and traditional
                    savings instruments.<sup>[3]</sup></li>
            </ul>

                    <p>
                        In April 2020, Franklin Templeton India wound up six credit funds with combined assets of close
                        to US$4 billion, citing liquidity issues during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                        SEBI conducted inquiries and later imposed restrictions on new debt schemes for the fund house

                        heavy redemptions owing to exposure to troubled corporates such as DHFL and
